# Live Project


## Introduction

In the last two weeks of my time in the tech academy, I worked with a team in developing a full scale Web Application in C#. Working on such large project was a big learning oportunity for me by fixing bugs and adding the requested features. I worked on some front end stories that allowed me to use my creative ideas to reach to the desired outcome. 

Here are some description of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets:

## Entity Model


This model creates a table to store information about the cast members. My goal was to create the table and add it to an existing database to display in the screen for the user to view. First I created the properties and then using CRUD funtionality used the create page to gather the information from user and then render it on the index page from the cast member side. The information could be also edited using the edit page or deleted.
